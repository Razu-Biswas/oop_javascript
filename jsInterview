What is a prototype chain
Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones.It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.

The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or __proto__ property whereas prototype on constructor function is available through Object.prototype.
